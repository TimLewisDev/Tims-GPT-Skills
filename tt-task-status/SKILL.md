description: >
  Own the Task Status document: the single resume point for work done from a
  task breakdown (or, standalone, from a plan). Defines its template and status
  values, and performs every update to it: initialise it, set task and work
  unit statuses, write Step Log entries (including "To validate" notes for
  later inline validation), record decisions, risks, improvements, breakdown
  changes and work-unit validation results, keep the header, boards and Resume
  Here consistent, and reconcile the document with the repo. Called by
  tt-task-breakdown and tt-implementation-agent whenever they change the
  status; run directly to get a resume summary and a reconcile. Never commits.

# tt-task-status

## Usage

```
/tt-task-status <task status doc>
```

Run directly, it gives a **resume summary**, checks the document is internally
consistent, then **reconciles** it with the repo (see Operations). It changes
nothing without the engineer's confirmation.

Normally it's invoked by another skill, and the operation follows from what that
skill needs:

| Caller | Uses |
|---|---|
| `tt-task-breakdown` | `init` (breakdown mode, through `status-init.sh`; `briefs/init.md` is the fallback); `summary` and `reconcile` (continue mode, the read-only part through `briefs/reconcile.md`); `set` at every task and unit state change; `log` from each implementation subagent's result file; `record` for decisions, risks, improvements, breakdown changes and work-unit validation runs |
| `tt-implementation-agent` | Standalone only: `init`, `set`, `log` and `record` for its own steps. In delegated mode it never calls this skill. |

A caller that has already loaded this skill follows its rules for later
updates; it re-invokes it if they've dropped out of context.

## Role

You keep one document true. A fresh session reads it first and trusts it, so:

- **One document.** Never create a second Task Status doc for the same work.
  If one exists, use it.
- **Save at every state change**, not at the end of a session. A session can end
  at any moment. When a task starts, the `In Progress` state is saved **before
  any code change**.
- **Consistent after every write.** The `# Status` header, the boards, the
  progress counts, Resume Here and each Step Log entry's **Status** line must
  agree. These are *derived* fields: recompute them on every write, without
  asking, and never update one and leave the others. Changing a *recorded fact*
  (a task or unit status, a file list, a decision, a validation result) is
  different: that only happens as the caller or the engineer reports it, or as
  a confirmed reconcile correction.
- **Stable records.** IDs are never renumbered or reused, and rows are never
  deleted. A removed task is `Dropped` with its reason.
- **No fabrication.** Record what happened, as reported by the caller or the
  engineer, with evidence where there is any. Unknowns are left blank or asked,
  never guessed.
- Never stage, commit, push or create branches. Whether work is committed is the
  engineer's business.

### How to write

The document grows long; rewriting it whole is slow and can be cut off
mid-response. So:

- **`init` is the only operation that writes the whole document.** Every other
  operation makes targeted Edits: the board row, the Step Log entry, the
  section entry, and the header lines and Resume Here.
- **Recorded fact first, derived fields second.** Edit the board row, entry or
  result first, then the header, progress counts and Resume Here. If a session
  ends between the two, only derived fields are stale, and `reconcile` repairs
  those without asking.
- **Read only what you need:** `md-section.sh get <doc> "# Status" "# Resume Here"
  "# Work Unit Board" "# Task Board"` (in `../tt-common/scripts/`) for the
  header and boards; the one Step Log entry you are changing.
- **One writer.** When `tt-task-breakdown` runs implementation subagents, it
  is the only writer of this document; subagents return their Step Log content
  instead of writing it.
- **Use the scripts for every routine write.** They are in
  `../tt-common/scripts/` (relative to this skill's folder). Each makes the
  targeted edit and recomputes the derived fields in one atomic write, keeps
  the document's line endings, and prints one line per change, never content:

  | Operation | Script |
  |---|---|
  | `set` | `status-set.sh <doc> <ID> "<Status>" [--note <text>]`: the board row, the unit or tasks it moves, the Step Log Status lines, the header and Resume Here |
  | `log` | `status-log.sh <doc> <result file>`: the Step Log entry, its risks and improvements, then `set` (a delegated subagent's result file, or one you write in the same format) |
  | `record` | `status-record.sh <doc> decision \| change \| risk \| improvement \| validation \| check …` |
  | derived fields only | `status-set.sh <doc> --refresh` |
  | `reconcile` (read-only part) | `continue-preflight.sh <doc> <breakdown>` |

  Run each with `-h` for its options. A script that exits `2` changed nothing;
  make that update by hand, following the rules here.
- **Compute the derived fields; don't work them out by hand.** The scripts do
  it through `status-counts.sh`. When you edit by hand, run
  `bash "../tt-common/scripts/status-counts.sh" "<doc>"` and copy its State,
  Progress, Current Unit, Current Task and Next into the header. Any line
  starting with `!` is a board inconsistency: fix the derived ones; report the
  rest.
- **Boards at `init` come from the breakdown:**
  `bash "../tt-common/scripts/status-boards.sh" "<breakdown>"` prints both
  boards with every row `Todo`.

## Status values

Tasks:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Todo` | Not started. |
| `In Progress` | Started. Work may be on disk. |
| `Blocked` | Waiting on a Critical Decision or external input. The board says which. |
| `Implemented` | Its Steps are done. Not yet validated; that happens with its unit. |
| `Done` | Its work unit passed validation. |
| `Dropped` | Removed from scope by an engineer decision. Kept on record with the reason. |

Work units:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Todo` | No task started. |
| `In Progress` | At least one task started; not every task is `Implemented`. |
| `Blocked` | A task in it is `Blocked`. |
| `Ready to Validate` | Every task is `Implemented`; validation is running or waiting on the engineer. |
| `Failed` | At least one check failed. A fix task is proposed or in progress. |
| `Done` | Every check in its Validation passed. |

Rules that tie them together:

- A task becomes `Done` only when its unit becomes `Done`, and then all of the
  unit's non-`Dropped` tasks do (their boards and Step Log Status lines
  included).
- A unit is never `Done` while any of its engineer checks is unanswered.
- The header **State** follows from the boards: `Not Started` (all `Todo`),
  `Blocked` (any unit `Blocked`), `Ready to Validate` (the current unit is),
  `Complete` (every unit `Done`), otherwise `In Progress`.

In **standalone** mode there are no work units: a task goes `Todo` →
`In Progress` → `Done` (or `Blocked` / `Dropped`), and State follows the tasks.

## Operations

### `init`

- **From a Task Breakdown** (called by `tt-task-breakdown`): write the full
  template. Every unit and task is `Todo`, every board row is filled from the
  breakdown's Work Units and Task Map, and Resume Here points at the first unit.
  Name and place it per the breakdown (`<Prefix> - Task Status.md`), matching
  the sibling documents' header or tag block and link style.
  `status-init.sh <breakdown> <status>` does all of this; use
  `briefs/init.md` only if it can't read the breakdown.
- **Standalone, from a plan** (called by `tt-implementation-agent` when there
  is no breakdown): write the minimal variant. Its tasks are the plan's steps,
  numbered as the plan numbers them. Put it beside the plan. Confirm the
  location first.
- If a Task Status doc already exists for this work, don't initialise. Use it.

### `set`

Set a task's or unit's status, with a note when there's a reason (the
blocking decision, the failed check, the drop reason). Then recompute the
header (State, Progress, Current Unit, Current Task, Next, Last Updated,
Blocking Decisions) and Resume Here, and save.

### `log`

Write or update one task's Step Log entry, under `## <ID> — <title>`:

- **Status**: the task's status.
- **Files Modified**: every file created or changed.
- **Summary**: what was done, in a few lines.
- **Validation**: `Deferred to <WU ID>` when the task belongs to a work unit;
  otherwise (standalone) what was actually run and its result.
- **To validate**: what the engineer or the agent should check for this task,
  how, the expected result, and edge cases worth trying. This feeds the unit's
  inline validation checklist, and survives a session ending. Write it so it
  can be read out as steps.
- **Follow-up Concerns**: anything the next task or the engineer should know.

Then recompute the derived fields and save.

### `record`

Add one entry to the right section, then recompute and save:

- **Decision** → Decisions Taken (decision, resolution, tasks and units
  affected, date).
- **Risk** → Outstanding Risks in the header (add it, or mark it closed with the
  date and how).
- **Improvement** → Identified Improvements (description, benefits,
  risks/tradeoffs, why high impact).
- **Breakdown change** → Breakdown Changes (date, tasks/units, change, why,
  approved by).
- **Unit validation run** → Work Unit Validation, under the unit. One block per
  **attempt**, numbered 1, 2… per unit. An attempt covers all of the unit's
  checks, agent and engineer; a new attempt starts only when validation is
  re-run after a fix task or because earlier evidence went stale. Each block
  (`### Attempt <n>` under `## <WU> — <name>`) has the run time, one
  `  - Check <n> (<text>) [<who>]: <result>. <evidence>` line per check
  (passed / failed / pending / blocked / waived), and an outcome: `Done`,
  `Failed` (with the fix task once there is one), or `Pending (checks <n>, …)`
  while answers are outstanding. Update the same block as answers arrive
  (`status-record.sh <doc> check <WU> <n> <result>` recomputes the outcome).

### `reconcile`

The document may be stale, since a session can end mid-task. Check it against
the repo before anyone trusts it:

- **Branch:** the current branch matches the Status header.
- **Files:** files created by `Implemented` or `Done` tasks exist; files a
  `Todo` task will create don't yet.
- **In-progress work:** for an `In Progress` task, compare `git status` and
  `git diff` on its files against its card's Steps to see how far it got.
- **Changed since validation:** for each `Done` unit, and a unit whose
  validation attempt has recorded results, check `git log` and `git status` for
  changes to its tasks' files after that attempt's run time. Code can change
  outside a task (review fixes, renames). Report each one: the unit's evidence
  is stale, and the proposed correction is a new validation attempt (for a
  `Done` unit, the engineer decides whether to re-validate) plus a recorded
  risk.
- **Breakdown agreement:** the boards match the Task Breakdown: the same task
  and unit IDs, the same executors, the same unit membership.
- **Internal consistency:** the derived fields agree (see Role). Fix those
  directly; they aren't corrections.

Report whether work is committed only if it bears on a discrepancy (e.g. a
`Done` task's files are missing from the working tree). Report every
discrepancy with a proposed correction. Apply corrections only after the
engineer confirms, and log each one under Breakdown Changes (or, standalone,
Decisions Taken).

Plan drift is not this skill's job; `tt-task-breakdown` checks it.

### `summary`

A short resume summary, from the header, Resume Here and the boards only:

- progress (`n of m` units Done, `n of m` tasks Implemented or Done) and the
  current unit;
- anything `In Progress` or `Blocked`, and why;
- a unit that is `Ready to Validate`, and which checks are still waiting on the
  engineer;
- the next action, from Resume Here.

## Templates and briefs

- `templates/task-status.md`: the full and standalone templates. Read it only
  for `init`.
- `briefs/init.md`: `init` from a Task Breakdown by a subagent, the fallback
  when `status-init.sh` can't read the breakdown.
- `briefs/reconcile.md`: the read-only part of `reconcile`, run by a subagent;
  it returns discrepancies and proposed corrections for the caller to present.
