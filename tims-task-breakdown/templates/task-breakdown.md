# Template: Task Breakdown

The final document is assembled from parts (see `skeleton.md` for the
manifest). Each part below ends with `<!-- tims:end -->` in the draft; the
marker is stripped when the document is built.

## `parts/00-header.md`

```markdown
<header or tag block matching sibling docs>

# <Feature>: Task Breakdown

- **Comprehensive tech plan:** <link> (plan read: revision <N>, <YYYY-MM-DD>)
- **Also:** Future Iterations <link> · Tech Plan (summary) <link> · Tech Proposals <link>
- **Task Status (resume here):** <link>
- **Repo:** `<absolute path>` · base `<branch>` · working branch `<branch, or "created in T00">`
- **Plan verified against:** `<base>` @ `<short sha>` on <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Build check:** <how the agent builds or compile-checks, from the repo's instructions or the engineer; or "engineer only">
- **ID key:** <each prefix the plan uses and where it is defined>

## Overview
<Plain English, 3–6 sentences: what's being built, in what order, and when there
is first something to see.>
