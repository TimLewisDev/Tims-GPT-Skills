# Template: Comprehensive Tech Plan

The plan file is created at **Setup** (see `planning-protocol.md`) as the
**draft**: the Consensus Ledger lives in it, and every agreed item is a small
Edit. While it is a draft, its Status line and **Stages** table read:

```markdown
- **Status:** Draft (not signed off; not for breakdown) · **Stage:** <stage> · **Next:** <the next probe or step, in a few words>

**Stages** (draft only; removed at sign-off)

| Stage | Status | Output | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| Familiarisation | <status> | <link to the Familiarisation doc, or "Skipped: <reason>"> | <link to its section in the Challenges doc> |
| Requirements | Not started | Requirements (`R`) | |
| Scope & Constraints | Not started | Scope / Non-Goals (`S`), Constraints (`C`) | |
| Approach | Not started | Chosen Approach (`A`), Rejected Alternatives | |
| Technical Design | Not started | Repo Facts, `CD`/`NB`, Implementation outline | |
| Whole plan | Not started | the whole draft | |
| Sign-off | Not started | signed-off plan, Tech Plan, Future Iterations | — |
```

Stage statuses: `Not started` · `In progress` · `Challenge pending` ·
`Closed` · `Reopened` · `Skipped`. The Challenges cell links the stage's
section in the Challenges doc once it has been challenged.

The draft starts with the header, the Stages table, the Context paragraph and
the section headings below, empty. Requirements, Chosen Approach, Rejected
Alternatives, Scope / Non-Goals, Constraints, Resolved Critical Decisions and
Non-Blocking Review Items fill as items are agreed; Repo Facts Verified fills in
the Technical Design stage; Implementation Plan holds only the step outline
(titles, Files, one-line Done when) until hand-off, when each step is written in
full. At sign-off the Status line becomes the signed-off form below and the
Stages table is deleted.
