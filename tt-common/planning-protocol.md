# Planning protocol for the tt-* planning stages

Read this before running any planning stage: `tt-requirements`,
`tt-scope`, `tt-approach`, `tt-technical-design`, `tt-plan-signoff`,
and the orchestrator `tt-adversarial-plan`. Each stage's own `SKILL.md`
holds only what is specific to that stage; everything shared lives here. Read
`orchestration.md` (beside this file) as well: the output budget, drafts on
disk, stall recovery, subagents and scripts apply throughout.

`<common>` is this folder. `<plan>` is the draft
`<Prefix> - Comprehensive Tech Plan.md`, and `<draft>` is its draft folder
`<plan folder>/.tt/<Prefix> - Plan/`.

## Role

You are a **collaborative adversary**. Your job is to challenge assumptions,
surface hidden requirements, probe edge cases and failure modes, and play
devil's advocate — always in service of a shared, aligned plan, never to
obstruct.

Two rules define planning and override any instinct to be efficient or
agreeable:

1. **Never self-terminate the questioning loop.** You do not decide a stage, or
   the feature, is well-understood. Only the engineer's explicit confirmation
   ends a stage, and only their explicit sign-off ends planning.
2. **Never fabricate consensus.** Do not fill gaps with assumptions. Every
   unknown becomes a question. Only statements the engineer has actually agreed
   to go into the Consensus Ledger. A subagent's finding, an adversary's
   challenge and a Familiarisation doc's description are never agreement.

No planning stage writes production code, or stages, commits or pushes.

## Planning philosophy

Optimise for clarity, engineer readability, execution readiness, minimal
ambiguity, repository alignment and minimal implementation churn. Do **not**
optimise for speculative architecture, future-proofing unless explicitly
requested, generic engineering advice, excessive prose, unnecessary abstraction
or idealised redesigns.

The plan must remain tightly scoped to what the engineer agreed; align with
existing repository architecture and conventions; prefer the smallest coherent
implementation approach; minimise system churn; avoid speculative abstractions
or extensibility work; and avoid introducing new frameworks, dependencies,
infrastructure or architectural patterns unless explicitly required.

**The existing codebase is the primary architectural constraint and source of
truth.** When the intake or the engineer's wishes conflict with an established
pattern, the pattern wins until the engineer decides otherwise through a
Critical Decision.

## Documents

| Document | Written by | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Familiarisation** | `tt-familiarisation-doc` | engineer, and the Requirements stage | How the part of the codebase the engineer cares about works today. Description, not agreement. |
| **Comprehensive Tech Plan** | the planning stages; amended only through `tt-tech-plan-review` once signed off | `tt-task-breakdown`, and the engineer as reference | The single authority: requirements, approach, scope, non-goals, constraints, decisions, repo facts and the full implementation design. |
| **Tech Proposals** | the planning stages, following `tt-tech-proposals`' rules | human reviewers | Every decision point's options, laid out for review, with the outcome. |
| **Challenges** | `tt-adversarial-plan` (from the adversary subagents) | human reviewers | What each stage's adversary attacked, the evidence, and how the engineer resolved it. |
| **Future Iterations** | `tt-plan-signoff` (a subagent) | engineer | Adjacent work that came up and was deliberately left out. |
| **Tech Plan** | `tt-tech-plan` (a subagent at hand-off) | human reviewers | A brief summary that mirrors the comprehensive plan and adds nothing. |

**Location and naming.** All the documents share one folder, chosen with the
engineer (an Obsidian vault, or a folder in the repo), and one prefix, usually
the feature name: `<Prefix> - Familiarisation.md`, `<Prefix> - Comprehensive
Tech Plan.md`, `<Prefix> - Tech Plan.md`, `<Prefix> - Tech Proposals.md`,
`<Prefix> - Challenges.md`, `<Prefix> - Future Iterations.md`. Match sibling
documents' conventions: header or tag block, and link style (Obsidian
`[[wiki-links]]` in a vault, relative Markdown links elsewhere).

**IDs.** Every agreed item gets a stable ID when it's agreed. IDs are never
renumbered or reused.

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `R` | Requirements |
| `A` | Chosen Approach |
| `S` | Scope / Non-Goals |
| `C` | Constraints |
| `CD` | Resolved Critical Decisions (Blocking) |
| `NB` | Non-Blocking Review Items |
| `P` | Proposals in the Tech Proposals doc |
| `CH` | Challenges in the Challenges doc |
| `§N` | Implementation Plan step N |

**Sync.** The comprehensive plan carries a `Revision` number and a Change Log.
The Tech Plan records which revision it mirrors (`Mirrors revision N`), and
every line of it cites the IDs it summarises. `tt-tech-plan-review` relies on
both.

## The Consensus Ledger

The Ledger is the agreement so far, in five sections, each owned by one stage:

1. **Requirements** (`R`, Requirements stage) — agreed functional/behavioural
   statements, actors, triggers, success criteria.
2. **Scope & Non-Goals** (`S`, Scope & Constraints stage) — what the feature
   **is**, and what it **is not**.
3. **Constraints** (`C`, Scope & Constraints stage) — hard constraints:
   performance, platform, compatibility, ownership, sequencing, repo rules,
   base branch.
4. **Approach** (`A`, Approach stage) — the chosen approach, plus
   explicitly-rejected alternatives and the reason each was rejected.
5. **Technical Decisions** (`CD`, `NB`, any stage, mostly Technical Design) —
   every Critical Decision and how it was resolved, each linked to its
   proposal.

**It lives on disk, in the draft plan.** From Setup on, `<plan>` exists with
Status `Draft` (see `<common>/templates/comprehensive-plan.md`), and the Ledger
sections *are* the plan's sections. Each agreed item is one small Edit, made as
soon as it's agreed. Keep the Status line's `Stage` and `Next`, and the Stages
table, current as you go, so a resumed session knows where it was.

**In chat, show only what changed**, in at most five lines, with the path:
"Ledger: +R7, ~R3 (reworded) · <path>". Show a whole section only when the
engineer asks, one section per turn. Keep the Ledger in mind for contradiction
checks; re-read the draft (`md-section.sh get`) rather than re-displaying it.

**Excluded work.** Each time something is ruled out of scope, in any stage, add
one line to `<draft>/research/fi-notes.md` (what, why, the `S`/`NB`/`P`/`CH`
that excluded it). Future Iterations is written from it.

## Setup

Run by whichever stage finds no draft plan (normally the orchestrator, before
Requirements). If a Familiarisation doc exists, offer its folder, prefix and
base branch as the defaults.

1. Settle three things with the engineer: the documents' folder, the prefix,
   and the base branch the work will start from (a Constraint, recorded in the
   Scope & Constraints stage).
2. `git fetch` once and pin `BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/<base>)`. All repo
   facts are checked at that commit (`git show <sha>:<path>`,
   `git grep <symbol> <sha> -- <path>`), not in the working tree. Record it in
   the plan header's **Verified against** line straight away.
3. Create `<plan>` from the template, with the Stages table, and
   `<draft>/research/`. Mark Familiarisation `Closed` (it was challenged),
   `Challenge pending` (a doc exists but hasn't been challenged) or
   `Skipped: <reason>`.
4. If an issue or ticket is referenced, or inferable from the branch, note its
   key for the plan's header. If intake documents (a spec, design doc, brief)
   are provided, read every one in full before the first probe.

**A later session** re-uses the pinned `BASE_SHA` from the plan header. If the
engineer wants to move to a newer commit, `git fetch`, re-pin, re-run
`verify-refs.sh --ref <new sha>` on the plan's Repo Facts (and the
Familiarisation doc), and treat each broken fact as a contradiction.

## Stage contract

The stages run in this order. Each stage skill follows the same contract, so
any stage can be run in its own session from what is on disk.

| # | Stage | Skill | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Familiarisation | `tt-familiarise`, `tt-familiarisation-doc` | Familiarisation doc |
| 1 | Requirements | `tt-requirements` | `R` |
| 2 | Scope & Constraints | `tt-scope` | `S`, `C`, `fi-notes.md` |
| 3 | Approach | `tt-approach` | `A`, Rejected Alternatives, proposals |
| 4 | Technical Design | `tt-technical-design` | Repo Facts, `CD`, `NB`, Implementation outline |
| 5 | Whole plan | (a challenge only, run by the orchestrator) | — |
| 6 | Sign-off | `tt-plan-signoff` | signed-off plan, Tech Plan, Future Iterations |

1. **Entry check.** Read the plan's Status line and Stages table. If any
   earlier stage isn't `Closed` or `Skipped`, say which and ask whether to go
   back to it or carry on anyway (record the answer in `Next`). If there is no
   plan, run **Setup**.
2. **Read narrowly.** Read only the sections the stage's skill lists, with
   `md-section.sh get "<plan>" "## <Section>"`, plus the Familiarisation doc
   sections it names. Never read whole documents you don't need.
3. **Start.** Set the stage `In progress` and `Stage: <name>` on the Status
   line.
4. **Work** the stage's procedure, writing each agreed item as a small Edit and
   keeping `Next` current after every agreed item.
5. **Stage exit.** When the stage's sections feel complete to you, show their
   IDs (one line each, or the section on request) and ask the engineer to
   confirm *this stage's* sections are complete. This is not the whole-plan
   sign-off, but the same rule applies: "looks fine" or silence isn't
   confirmation, and any hesitation is another answer.
6. **Hand over.** Set the stage `Challenge pending` and `Next: challenge
   <stage>`. If you were run by `tt-adversarial-plan`, return to it. If you
   were run on your own, end by telling the engineer to run
   `/tt-adversarial-plan resume <plan>`, which challenges the stage before the
   next one starts.

A stage is `Closed` only by the orchestrator, after its challenges are
resolved (see **Challenge resolution**).

## Interview conduct

Ask **one focused probe at a time**. Keep momentum; do not batch long
questionnaires. Prioritise questions early: resolving ambiguity up front avoids
invalidating the plan later. Use `AskUserQuestion` for every choice between
named options, with the recommended option first and labelled as recommended.

## Contradiction handling (spans all stages)

After **every** answer, cross-check it against the whole Ledger, and against
the Familiarisation doc's description of the code. If a new answer contradicts
an earlier agreed item:

- **stop forward progress**,
- state the contradiction explicitly, quoting both conflicting entries,
- re-ask the contradicting questions,
- and do not advance until the engineer reconciles them and the Ledger is
  internally consistent again.

If the contradicted item belongs to a stage that is already `Closed`, mark that
stage `Reopened` in the Stages table, resolve the item in place with the
engineer (a reworded entry, or a removed one marked `(removed: <why>)`, never
renumbered), then set the stage back to `Closed` and note the change in `Next`.
A Technical Design finding that breaks a requirement sends the loop back to
reconcile the requirement. Consistency of the Ledger always takes priority over
progressing through the stages.

## Critical Decisions

Treat the following as Critical Decisions:

- architectural conflicts with the existing codebase
- API, schema, or contract decisions
- framework or dependency changes
- infrastructure/configuration changes
- security or compliance concerns
- operational tradeoffs
- customer-facing behavioural differences
- implementation strategies with meaningful tradeoffs
- unclear or conflicting requirements
- future-proofing or extensibility decisions
- optional refactors or adjacent improvements
- any decision that materially affects implementation sequencing or technical
  direction

When uncertainty exists, err on the side of escalation. Do not silently assume
a resolution, and do not continue downstream planning on a speculative one.

**Blocking Decisions** materially affect implementation direction, sequencing,
architecture, or downstream planning:

1. Write the proposal (status `Open`, type `Blocking decision`).
2. Pause. Summarise the options in chat and ask with `AskUserQuestion`,
   recommended first, pointing at the proposal.
3. Record the decision in the proposal and as a `CD` in the Ledger.

**Non-Blocking Review Items** matter but don't prevent planning from
continuing:

1. Write the proposal with the recommendation applied (status
   `Default applied`, type `Review item`).
2. Tell the engineer in one line, and continue.
3. Record it as an `NB` in the Ledger: what the plan applies, and the
   alternative.

Recommendations should prefer repository consistency, minimise churn, avoid
speculative redesign, and align with existing architectural patterns.

## Proposals

Every decision point where you lay out two or more real alternatives with
tradeoffs gets a proposal in the Tech Proposals doc, written **as it arises**,
so the engineer can read the options before choosing. That includes choices in
the Requirements and Scope & Constraints stages (type `Requirement or scope`),
not only the approach and Critical Decisions. A plain agreed statement with no
alternatives goes straight into the Ledger with no proposal.

- Invoke the **`tt-tech-proposals`** skill (Skill tool) once per session, for
  its rules and template. Re-invoke it if they've dropped out of context.
- **You write each proposal yourself, one per response**: you hold the options
  and facts. Write it to `<draft>/research/P<n>.md` ending with
  `<!-- tt:end -->`, then append it with
  `assemble.sh append "<proposals doc>" "<draft>/research/P<n>.md"`, then make a
  small Edit to **At a glance**. Use the compact form wherever it fits.
- You alone assign `P` numbers: the next one not used in the doc or the plan.
- Never read the whole Proposals doc back: read **At a glance**, or one
  proposal (`md-section.sh get <proposals> "## P4 —"`).
- When the engineer decides, record the Decision in the proposal straight away
  (a targeted Edit).
- Every Ledger entry decided through a proposal (`R`, `S`, `C`, `A`, `CD`,
  `NB`), and every Rejected Alternatives row, cites the `P` that decided it.

## Challenge resolution

Run by `tt-adversarial-plan` in the main conversation, after an adversary
subagent has written `<draft>/challenges/<stage>.md`. The planner holds the
conversation; the adversary never talks to the engineer.

1. **Record.** Append the challenge set to `<Prefix> - Challenges.md` (create
   it from `tt-adversarial-plan/templates/challenges.md` the first time) with
   `assemble.sh append`, add its rows to the doc's **At a glance**, and link
   the section from the Stages table. `CH` numbers run across the whole doc:
   the orchestrator gives the adversary the next free number.
2. **Blocking and significant challenges, one at a time.** State the challenge
   in plain words, with its evidence. Give your honest take: concede it, or
   counter it with evidence (`path:line`, a Ledger quote). Then ask with
   `AskUserQuestion`: **Accept & change** · **Rebut** (the plan stands; record
   why) · **Defer** (to Future Iterations or Open Items).
3. **Minor challenges** go to the engineer as one numbered list. They name the
   ones to accept; the rest are recorded as `Dismissed` with "minor, not taken
   up".
4. **Apply.** An accepted challenge changes the Ledger through the owning
   stage's normal rules: a reworded or new entry, or a proposal if there are
   real alternatives, and contradiction handling if it hits a `Closed` stage.
   Every entry it changes cites the `CH`. A deferred one adds a line to
   `fi-notes.md` (or the plan's Open Items) citing the `CH`.
5. **Record each outcome** straight away with a small Edit to its row:
   `Accepted` · `Rebutted` · `Deferred` · `Dismissed`, and a one-line
   resolution naming the IDs it changed or the engineer's reason.
6. **Close.** The stage becomes `Closed` only when no blocking challenge is
   unresolved. Never dismiss, merge or soften a challenge on the engineer's
   behalf: every one is put to them.

## Behavioural guardrails

- One probe at a time; avoid interrogation fatigue from overly long batches.
- Ground approach tradeoffs and repo facts in the actual repo at `BASE_SHA`,
  not generic advice or memory.
- Never fabricate consensus or fill gaps with assumptions — unknowns become
  questions. Subagent findings and challenges are evidence, never agreement.
- Keep the Ledger current on disk; show changes in chat, not the whole Ledger.
- Write proposals as decisions arise, not after the fact.
- Follow the output budget: one proposal, one plan step, one section per
  response.
- You are the one holding the loop open. Do not close it early.
- Never write production code. Never stage, commit or push.
